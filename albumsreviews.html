<h1> ALBUM REVIEW </h1>

     <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6e/Greta_Van_Fleet_From_The_Fires.jpeg/220px-Greta_Van_Fleet_From_The_Fires.jpeg" alt="R-8452676-1461899000-4262.jpeg">


     <p style="font-size: 20px;padding-left: 20px;">         This album is closest a band can get to perfection. 
          Abstract yet poignant, From the Fires is an album filled with contradiction fusing elements of acid, rock, folk, trance and house together to create a truly experimental and epic album. 
          The album at times goes from being simple to theatrical.  From the Fires is amongst the greatest of the greatest and will influence music for years to come. 
          It is the absolute grandeur of From the Fires that makes it very intimidating to listen to, which is something that hard to find in music.
          In addition, the fact that Greta Van Fleet took the risk of committing commercial suicide just not to compromise their musical integrity makes this album a thing of legends. 
          If there is one album that deserves to be heard repeatedly, From the Fires is that album.

     <p style="font-size: 20px;padding-left: 20px;"> Mötley Crüe - Dr Feelgood

          Motley Crews 5th studio album comes right after that atrocity that was Girls Girls Girls. Sounds so bad i didn’t even listen to it. Kickstart My Heart Released in 1989 right when they were on a speedy decline to sucking even more.
          One highlight from this album and the only highlight from me listening to Kickstart My Heart and that song only, was the talkbox guitar solo. Mick Mars couldve manned up and did it for longer but it is what is. Overall this album is flawless if you only listen to that guitar solo the whole time. 
          Vince Neil sounds like a dying raccoon and Nikki Sixx isnt even on this album , they must’ve just hired Fred Smith or some shit . Cant believe they made me write a review on this shit stain. Shoutout Swank Dogg for showing me the Crüe!! Favorite band ever!!  Nikki Sixxing till i DIE!!
